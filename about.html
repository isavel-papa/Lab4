            <p>DISCLAIMER: For all intents and purposes, Gatastico Pet Shop is not a real company. It was formed by Isavel Papa for Lab 4 in April of 2019. The Gatastico logo was found on the internet and was chosen for its cuteness. </p>
            <p>Gatastico always dreamed of being a pet shop. However, after stumbling across their logo, they decided to focus more on cats. Gatastico is in the business of connecting paw-rents to their purrr-fect chonky companion!</p>
            <p>Originally, they wanted to be iconically ironic and sell dogs. However, after careful deliberation, cats were the way to go. The CEO (pictured) can personally attest to how important fostering a furry friend is. It drastically impacts the life of your new child and the parents themselves and changes it for the better. Gatastico is here to answer the call for chonky pets.</p>
            <p class="center">Check out our site and connect with your lifelong chonky companion today!</p>
